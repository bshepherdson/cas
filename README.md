# CubeOS Assembler

This is a DCPU-16 1.7 assembler designed for use with CubeOS. No other assembler meets the needs of the CubeOS project. In particular it needs to handle folding complex expressions back into constants, and have the option to produce 0x10 Standards Committee relocation tables with binaries.

## Current State

The current state is an import of a DCPU-16 1.1 emulator I (shepheb) wrote soon after the announcement of 0x10c. It will be updated to 1.7 and the necessary features added.
